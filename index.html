            Users generally coped well with the interface; on some screens, users were able to make quick decisions (< 5 seconds), while on others they would take longer (~30 seconds). Particularly, when choosing a language and meal category (e.g. ‘sandwiches & meals,’ ‘fries,’ desserts), users navigated rapidly, but when choosing between an entree and a meal, or when selecting a drink, selections took longer. Total time from start to checkout differed between individuals ordering alone versus in pairs, taking ~1:45 minutes for individuals and ~3:30 minutes for couples.
