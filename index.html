            <ul id="bullets">
                <li>Users generally coped well with the interface; on some screens, users were able to make quick decisions (< 5 seconds), while on others they would take longer (~30 seconds).</li>
                <li> Particularly, when choosing a language and food category (e.g. 'desserts'), users navigated rapidly, but in choosing between an entree and a meal, or when selecting a drink, selections took longer.</li>
                <li>Total time from start to checkout differed between individuals ordering alone versus in pairs, taking <strong>~1:45 minutes for individuals and ~3:30 minutes for couples.</strong></li>

                Takeaways from interviewing users
            </h1>
            <ul id="bullets_last">
                <li>Among three interviewees, one was a first-time user and the others had used the McDonalds kiosk multiple times.</li>
                <li>Two interviewees listed the kiosk as their preferred order method due to intuitiveness and speed of use, while the third interviewee prefers using his phone for hygienic reasons.</li>
                <li>Two dissatisfactions voiced by users were <strong>poor responsiveness to usage of the ‘Help’ button</strong>, and <strong>buggy behavior from the touchpad</strong> (e.g. buttons shift when trying to add pickles to a meal).</li>
                <li>All interviewees ordered items identical to what they had planned on ordering coming into McDonalds.</li>
